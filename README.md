# country-clustering-analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and clustering of countries based on socioeconomic and health factors. The project leverages unsupervised machine learning techniques, including K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, to identify countries that require the most assistance.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights into the data through visualization and statistical methods.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Applying unsupervised learning techniques to group countries based on similarities in socioeconomic and health indicators.
- **Visualization**: Creating intuitive charts and graphs to communicate findings effectively.
- **Actionable Insights**: Providing recommendations for humanitarian organizations like HELP International to prioritize their efforts.

## Objectives

1. Identify clusters of countries with similar socioeconomic and health profiles.
2. Highlight countries that are most in need of humanitarian assistance.
3. Provide a data-driven foundation for resource allocation and decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
